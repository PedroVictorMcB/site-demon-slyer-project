# site-demon-slyer-project

This project was made by watching the Semana do Zero ao Programador Contratado, on youtube offered by Dev em Dobro.

Here I'm learning more about HTML, CSS, and JS.

Until the moment, I learned that in order to use the CSS and JS in HTML, we need to link the languages. Learned that the responsive design help the user to have a better navegation on other screens, beyond the PC screen. Learned how to use classes, in order to acess some data, how to import font type and use, and other things.

The project isn't over yet. So I'm still learning about how to make a web site.

Thanks Dev em Dobro for your wisdom!
